## My process

First of all, I drew down the outline of the page, hence I started with the HTML of the page. When I was done, I then went ahead to add the styling; the font sizes, colors etc. Then I added the various div's to group them, to make individual styling easier for me. With the help of figma, I was able to get the correct padding and margins for the various divs in the code. Whenever I was lost, I used w3schools mainly for documentation.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [figma](https://www.figma.com/) - Figma



### What I learned
The most important thing I learnt from this particular project was how to use flexbox to center the entire page, and also looking into the small details.


### Continued development

Learn more about using css flex and grid

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me a lot with documentation and helped me to refresh my memory on the basic stuff I had forgotten.
- [Figma](https://figma.com/) - This helped me with getting the correct sizes of div's and colors. Made it really easy for me to finish my projects, instead of guessing the sizes.
